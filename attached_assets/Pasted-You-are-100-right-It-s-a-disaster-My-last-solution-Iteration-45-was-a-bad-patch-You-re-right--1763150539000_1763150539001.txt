You are 100% right. It's a disaster.

My last solution (Iteration 45) was a bad patch. You're right, it's a confusing, messy experience. Seeing "Platform Stats" when you don't even have an organization is distracting noise. It violates our #1 mandate: One Job, One Screen.

A new user has one job: get started. We must give them one screen to do it.

My original idea (Iteration 44) was the right one. A new user should not see the dashboard at all. They should be immediately redirected to a clean, full-page "Welcome" screen.

This is the best UX strategy. It's clean, it's focused, and it's impossible to get wrong.

🚀 The Real Fix (Iteration 46): The "Hard Redirect" Welcome Page
Goal: Provide a "super clear and clean" onboarding experience by forcing all new users (with no org) to a single, dedicated /welcome page.

Your Mandate (Part 1: The Redirect)

This is the most critical part. We must stop new users from ever seeing the main dashboard.

Find your "Auth Loader" Component: This is the top-level component that wraps your entire app, fetches the user, and decides what to show (e.g., App.tsx, Layout.tsx, or AuthProvider.tsx).

Add the Redirect Logic:

JavaScript

import { useAuth } from './hooks/useAuth'; // Your auth hook
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { useNavigate, useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Loader2 } from 'lucide-react';

// This is the component that runs right after login
function AppRouter() {
  const { user, isLoading: isAuthLoading } = useAuth();
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const location = useLocation();

  // Fetch the user's orgs
  const { data: orgs, isLoading: isOrgsLoading } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['/api/users/me/organizations'],
    enabled: !!user, // Only run if the user is loaded
  });

  if (isAuthLoading || isOrgsLoading) {
    return <Loader2 className="animate-spin" />;
  }

  // --- THIS IS THE FIX ---
  if (user && orgs.length === 0 && location.pathname !== '/welcome') {
    // We have a new user who is NOT on the welcome page.
    // Force them there.
    navigate('/welcome', { replace: true });
    return null; // Don't render the rest of the app
  }

  if (user && orgs.length > 0 && location.pathname === '/welcome') {
    // This user *has* an org but is on the welcome page.
    // Force them to the dashboard.
    navigate('/dashboard', { replace: true });
    return null;
  }
  // --- END FIX ---

  // User is good. Render the main app.
  return <YourMainAppLayout />;
}
Your Mandate (Part 2: The "Welcome" Page)

Now, we create the clean, full-screen page they get redirected to.

Create the File: src/pages/Welcome.tsx

Add the UI: This page has one button and no other distractions.

JavaScript

// src/pages/Welcome.tsx
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';
import { Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardContent, CardDescription } from '@/components/ui/card';
import { Plus } from 'lucide-react';

export function WelcomePage() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  const handleCreateOrg = () => {
    // Navigate to the *existing* page where an admin can create an org.
    navigate('/admin/org-settings'); 
  };

  return (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen bg-gray-50">
      <Card className="w-full max-w-lg shadow-2xl">
        <CardHeader className="text-center">
          <CardTitle className="text-3xl font-bold">
            Welcome to Dugout Desk!
          </CardTitle>
          <CardDescription className="text-lg">
            Let's get you set up.
          </CardDescription>
        </CardHeader>
        <CardContent className="text-center">
          <p className="mb-8 text-base text-gray-700">
            You're not part of an organization yet. To use the app,
            you must first create one for your league or tournament.
          </p>

          <Button 
            onClick={handleCreateOrg} 
            className="w-full text-lg py-8"
            data-testid="button-create-org"
          >
            <Plus className="w-5 h-5 mr-2" />
            Create Your Organization
          </Button>

          {/* This is a clean, "One Job" screen. We are intentionally
            omitting all other links, stats, or navigation.
          */}
        </CardContent>
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
}
Post-Check: The New, Clean Flow
Log out.

Sign up as a brand new user.

Confirm: After login, you are instantly redirected to the full-screen /welcome page. You never see the main dashboard, stats, or "Request Access" buttons.

Confirm: The only clickable action is the "Create Your Organization" button.

Click it.

Confirm: You are taken to /admin/org-settings.

After you create the org, you're navigated back to the dashboard, and this time, the redirect doesn't fire because orgs.length is no longer 0.

This is the clean, foolproof, "no distractions" workflow you were asking for. This is the right way to build it.
