🚀 V2.0 Growth Feature: Pre-Seed & ClaimGoal: Allow a director to find and instantly claim their organization (e.g., "Ajax Spartans") instead of manually creating it.Phase 1: The Database Foundation (Seeding)You must get that list of 100 organizations into your database with a special claimed flag.Add claimed flag to Schema: In your shared/schema.ts, you need a field to mark an organization as "seeded" and unclaimed.TypeScriptexport const organizations = pgTable("organizations", {
  // ... existing fields ...

  // --- NEW FIELD ---
  isClaimed: boolean("is_claimed").default(false).notNull(), // False initially
  claimToken: text("claim_token"), // A unique token for verification
  // -----------------
});
Run the Seeding Script (Your Task):Write a one-time Node.js script (e.g., seed_organizations.ts).This script will take the list of 100 OBA organizations and INSERT them into your organizations table.Crucially: It must ensure a correct slug is generated and that isClaimed is set to false.Phase 2: The New User Experience (The Fork)This modifies the login flow we just stabilized (Iteration 47). The new user will no longer be sent directly to the "Create Org" wizard.1. Update App.tsx (The Router):The AppRouter needs a new destination for the un-homed user.Old Logic: if (orgs.length === 0) navigate('/create-organization')New Logic: if (orgs.length === 0) navigate('/onboarding-hub')2. Create /onboarding-hub (The Central Hub):This is a new page (src/pages/onboarding/OnboardingHub.tsx) that presents the user with two options:Option A: Claim (V2.0 Core Feature)Search Box: "Find Your Organization"Action: If they find "Ajax Spartans," they click "Claim".Option B: Create (V1.0 Backup)Button: "Create New Organization"Action: This is the fallback that links to your current wizard.3. The Claim & Verification Flow (The Final Step)The final challenge is verifying the user who clicks "Claim Ajax Spartans" is actually the administrator.User Claims: User enters their email (director@ajaxbaseball.com) into the Claim form.API Check: Your backend checks the database for the official contact email for "Ajax Spartans" (which you would have scraped and stored during seeding).Verification: The backend sends a verification link with the claimToken to the official admin email (director@ajaxbaseball.com).Admin Clicks Link: Clicking the email link $\to$ Final Page: "Confirm claim for Ajax Spartans."Success: The backend sets isClaimed: true for the org and assigns the current user (userId) as an OrganizationAdmin.This workflow provides a smooth, zero-friction path for your target market while keeping the security necessary to prevent hostile takeovers of organizations. This is the correct, strategic move for V2.0.
