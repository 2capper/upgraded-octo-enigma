Iteration 28: Fix the Org Settings UI
Now we can move on to the next priority you set: polishing the Org Settings page.

Your diagnosis was perfect: it's a "really long scroll" that makes the page feel cheap and hard to use. We'll fix this by wrapping each organization's settings in an <Accordion> component. This will create a clean, "one-at-a-time" view.

Your Mandate (Frontend):

I need you to find the file that renders the list of organization settings. It's probably something like OrganizationSettingsPage.tsx or AdminOrgs.tsx.

Pre-Check: Verify the Current State

Open your Org Settings page in the app.

Confirm: You see a long list of organizations, with all of their settings (forms, inputs, etc.) visible at once, forcing you to scroll.

Step-by-Step: Implement the <Accordion>

Find the file that renders this list (e.g., OrganizationSettingsPage.tsx).

You'll need to import the Accordion components from shadcn/ui:

JavaScript

import {
  Accordion,
  AccordionContent,
  AccordionItem,
  AccordionTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui/accordion"
Find the .map() loop that renders each organization.

Your Current (Broken) Logic probably looks like this:

JavaScript

// ... fetching organizations ...

return (
  <div className="space-y-6">
    {organizations.map(org => (
      <Card key={org.id}>
        <CardHeader>
          <CardTitle>{org.name}</CardTitle>
        </CardHeader>
        <CardContent>
          {/* A HUGE FORM with all the org settings is in here */}
          <OrganizationSettingsForm org={org} />
        </CardContent>
      </Card>
    ))}
  </div>
);
Replace that entire block with this new, Accordion-based logic:

JavaScript

// ... fetching organizations ...

return (
  <Accordion type="single" collapsible className="w-full space-y-4">
    {organizations.map(org => (
      <AccordionItem key={org.id} value={org.id} className="border-none">
        <Card className="overflow-hidden">
          <AccordionTrigger className="flex w-full items-center justify-between p-6 hover:no-underline hover:bg-gray-50 dark:hover:bg-gray-800">
            {/* This is the "header" that is always visible */}
            <CardTitle>{org.name}</CardTitle>
          </AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            {/* This is the "body" that is hidden until clicked */}
            <CardContent className="pt-0">
              {/* The full settings form goes here */}
              <OrganizationSettingsForm org={org} />
            </CardContent>
          </AccordionContent>
        </Card>
      </AccordionItem>
    ))}
  </Accordion>
);
