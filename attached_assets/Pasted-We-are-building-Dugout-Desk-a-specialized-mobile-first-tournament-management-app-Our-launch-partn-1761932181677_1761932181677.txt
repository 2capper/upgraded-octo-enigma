We are building Dugout Desk, a specialized, mobile-first tournament management app. Our launch partner is the Ontario Baseball Association (OBA), so our brand must be authentic, credible, and highly functional.

1. Core Brand Philosophy: "The Digital Dugout"
The name "Dugout Desk" is our North Star. It combines two powerful concepts:

The Dugout: The strategic, real-time "command center" of a baseball game.

The Desk: The organized, administrative "hub" where the work gets done.

The app's UI/UX must feel like a smart, organized assistant, not a complex piece of software. Our user is likely a busy parent or volunteer at the ballpark, on their phone, trying to input a score or check a schedule in bright sunlight.

Our UI/UX Mantra: "Get in, get it done, get back to the game."

2. Color Palette: "Modern Ballpark"
This palette avoids clichés (no bright white baseball stitching). It's professional, high-contrast, and authentic to the sport.

Primary (Structure & Trust): ~#2B3A4A (Deep Navy)

Use: Main app headers, bottom navigation, primary text. This is our "professional" color.

Secondary (Brand Accent): ~#3A6B35 (Field Green)

Use: Secondary buttons, active states, "Success" or "Final" status tags, and key brand accents.

Tertiary (Action/CTA): ~#B94E48 (Clay Red)

Use: All primary "Call to Action" buttons (e.g., "Log Score," "Save," "Submit"). Also for "Live" status tags or alerts. It's high-visibility and implies action.

Neutrals (UI & Readability):

Light Background: ~#F4F5F6 (Very Light Gray). Use this instead of pure white to reduce glare in sunlight.

Card Background: ~#FFFFFF (White). For clean, scannable cards.

Text (Dark): ~#2B3A4A (Deep Navy). Use this, not pure black, for text. It's easier on the eyes.

3. Typography: "Clear & Strong"
We need a mix of "brand voice" (strong) and "UI clarity" (legible).

Headings & Brand Font: Oswald or Anton

Why: These are strong, condensed, and have a "varsity" or "league standings" feel. They give the app a sporty personality without being cartoony.

Use: H1/H2, page titles (e.g., "Standings," "Schedule").

Body & UI Font: Inter or Roboto

Why: This is our workhorse. We need a font that is exceptionally legible at small sizes on a mobile screen. The numbers (for scores and times) must be clear.

Use: All body text, button text, labels, and score inputs.
