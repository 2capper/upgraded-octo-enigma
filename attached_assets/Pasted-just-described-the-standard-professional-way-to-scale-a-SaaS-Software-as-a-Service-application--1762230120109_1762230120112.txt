just described the standard, professional way to scale a SaaS (Software as a Service) application.

Your thinking is perfectly correct:

www.dugoutdesk.com (The Storefront): This is your marketing website. Its job is to attract new organizations, explain the features (Tournaments, Expenses, Bookings), show pricing, and get new admins to sign up.

app.dugoutdesk.ca (The Application): This is the product itself. This is where users log in to use the tools you've built.

The challenge you've identified is that your Tournament App has two different audiences:

Audience 1 (Private): An Admin from "LaSalle Baseball" who logs into app.dugoutdesk.ca to create and manage their tournament.

Audience 2 (Public): A Coach from "Windsor Hawks" (who doesn't have an account) who just wants to find and view the LaSalle tournament.

You can and should serve both from the same system. The solution is to add a simple "Visibility" setting to your tournaments.

Here is the complete game plan to achieve this.

The "Public Directory" Game Plan
This plan lets your app be both a private admin tool and a public directory.

Step 1: Add "Visibility" to Your Database
In your Drizzle schema, add one new column to your tournaments table. This is the "master switch."

TypeScript

// drizzle/schema.ts
export const tournaments = pgTable('tournaments', {
  // ... all your existing columns like id, name, organizationId ...
  
  // --- ADD THIS COLUMN ---
  visibility: text('visibility', { enum: ['private', 'public', 'unlisted'] })
    .notNull()
    .default('private'),
});
Here's what these settings mean:

private (Default): The tournament is hidden. Only logged-in members of the organization that created it can see it.

public: The tournament is visible to everyone and will appear in your new "Public Directory."

unlisted: (A "nice-to-have" feature) The tournament is hidden from the directory, but anyone with the direct link can view the schedule and standings.

Step 2: Update Your Admin Panel
In your app.dugoutdesk.ca admin panel, find the "Create Tournament" / "Edit Tournament" form.

Add a new radio button group that updates this visibility field.

Tournament Visibility:

(•) Private: Only members of my organization can find this. ( ) Public: List this tournament in the public directory for any team to find. ( ) Unlisted: Anyone with the direct link can view (but not listed publicly).

Step 3: Create the Public Directory Page (On Your "Storefront")
Now, you create a new page on your www.dugoutdesk.com site. This will be your "storefront" for teams.

Create a New Page: www.dugoutdesk.com/tournaments

Create a New Public API Endpoint: You need a new API endpoint that is not protected by authentication.

TypeScript

// server/routes.ts

// This endpoint is OPEN to the public. No auth needed.
app.get('/api/public/tournaments', async (req, res) => {
  // Find all tournaments that are marked 'public'
  const publicTournaments = await db.query.tournaments.findMany({
    where: (tournaments, { eq }) => eq(tournaments.visibility, 'public'),
    with: {
      organization: {
        columns: { name: true } // Also send back the org's name
      }
    }
  });
  res.json(publicTournaments);
});
Build the UI: On your /tournaments page, fetch data from this new /api/public/tournaments endpoint and display them as a list of "Tournament Cards."

Each card would show:

Tournament Name

Hosting Organization (e.g., "Hosted by Forest Glade Baseball")

Dates

Age Divisions

A "View Schedule" button that links to the public dashboard: app.dugoutdesk.ca/dashboard/[tournament_id]

Your New, Unified Structure
This plan gives you the "best of both worlds":

Site	Purpose	Who Uses It?
www.dugoutdesk.com	Storefront (Marketing)	Organization Admins looking to buy your software.
www.dugoutdesk.com/tournaments	Public Directory (Search)	Team Coaches/Parents looking to find tournaments.
app.dugoutdesk.ca	The Application (Product)	Logged-in Users who are managing tournaments, expenses, or bookings.

Export to Sheets

This model is powerful because your private admin app (app.dugoutdesk.ca) becomes the engine that populates your public-facing directory (www.dugoutdesk.com/tournaments). It all works together from one database.

Would you like to start by sketching out the Drizzle schema for that visibility column and the API endpoint to fetch public tournaments?
