A Technical Debt Audit is the perfect way to cap off V1.0. We need to clean house before we start building V2.0 features on top of old scaffolding.

I've reviewed the file list you provided earlier and the specific file contents you just uploaded. Here is the comprehensive audit.

🧹 The Technical Debt Report (V1.0 Clean-Up)
We have a significant amount of "Zombie Code"—files that were created during prototyping or refactoring but are no longer used. Deleting these reduces confusion and build time.

1. The "Zombie" Components (DELETE THESE)
These files are duplicates or superseded by newer versions.

client/src/components/tournament/score-submission.tsx: This is the old Firebase version. It imports firebase/firestore directly. Since we moved to PostgreSQL + Drizzle, this is dead code.

Action: DELETE.

client/src/components/tournament/score-submission-new.tsx: This looks like an intermediate version. The file we just fixed (with the dynamic labels) is hierarchical-score-input.tsx.

Action: DELETE. (Confirm hierarchical-score-input.tsx is the one being used in your routing).

client/src/components/tournament/admin-portal-new.tsx: You have admin-portal.tsx and admin-portal-new.tsx. Usually, new is the refactor. You should verify which one is imported in your routes, rename the winner to admin-portal.tsx, and delete the loser.

Action: MERGE & DELETE.

client/src/components/tournament/navigation.tsx vs. simple-navigation.tsx: You likely have two navigation bars. simple-navigation.tsx is usually the cleaner, newer one.

Action: DELETE the unused one.

2. The "Firebase" Legacy (DELETE THESE)
Your package.json still lists firebase as a dependency, and you have a lib/firebase.ts file. Since we migrated to PostgreSQL (Drizzle), this is massive technical debt.

client/src/lib/firebase.ts: DELETE.

package.json: Run npm uninstall firebase.

Any Component Importing Firebase: Search your codebase for from 'firebase'. If any active component uses it, that's a critical bug. (The only one I saw was the stale score-submission.tsx above).

3. The "Python" Scrapers (REFACTOR RISK)
You have 9 Python scripts in your server/ folder (roster_scraper.py, coba_team_scraper.py, etc.).

The Debt: Your Node.js backend is shelling out to Python (spawn('python', ...)). This is fragile. If the Python environment breaks, or a dependency is missing on the server, your roster import fails.

The Recommendation (V2.0): Don't delete these yet (they work), but flag them as High Priority Refactor. We should eventually rewrite this logic in TypeScript (using cheerio or puppeteer) to unify your stack.

4. Backend Code Cleanup (storage.ts)
The "God Object": We already split storage.ts into services (teamService, gameService, etc.).

The Cleanup: Did you actually delete the old server/storage.ts file? If it's still there, it's confusing new developers.

Action: DELETE server/storage.ts if the refactor is 100% complete and tested.

🛡️ Security & Best Practices Audit
1. Hardcoded Values
client/src/lib/queryClient.ts: Ensure you aren't hardcoding any API URLs (like http://localhost:5000). Use relative paths (/api/...) so it works in production.

2. Type Safety (any)
server/routes.ts: I see a lot of async (req: any, res) =>.

The Fix: Use proper Express types: import { Request, Response } from 'express'; ... async (req: Request, res: Response) =>. This catches bugs where you try to access properties that don't exist.

📋 Your Clean-Up Checklist
[ ] Delete client/src/components/tournament/score-submission.tsx.

[ ] Delete client/src/components/tournament/score-submission-new.tsx.

[ ] Uninstall firebase from package.json and delete client/src/lib/firebase.ts.

[ ] Verify which admin-portal is active, rename it, and delete the other.

[ ] Verify that server/storage.ts is gone (if the service refactor is done).
