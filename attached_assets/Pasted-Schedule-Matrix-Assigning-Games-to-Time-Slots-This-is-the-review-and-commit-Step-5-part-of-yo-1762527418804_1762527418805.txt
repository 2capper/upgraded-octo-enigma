Schedule Matrix" (Assigning Games to Time Slots)
This is the "review and commit" (Step 5) part of your wizard. This is a "grid-based" task and is much more complex. The goal is to make a "busy" screen feel simple and to prevent conflicts.

Here is the UI/UX I recommend:

The "Unscheduled Game Bank": This is the most important UI concept. After your "Engine" (Step 4) generates the matchups, display them in a "bank" or "sidebar."

Example: A scrolling list of cards: [Falcons vs Hawks], [Jays vs Titans], [Hawks vs Jays].

UX: The user's only job is to drag these game cards from the bank onto the calendar grid. This is far simpler than having them create games on the calendar.

Instant Conflict Detection (The "Killer Feature"): This is the magic. Your UI must do the heavy lifting.

Scenario: The user drags [Falcons vs Hawks] towards the Sat 8:00 AM slot on Diamond 1.

UX: As they are hovering (before they drop!), your UI must instantly check: "Are the Falcons or the Hawks already playing at 8:00 AM on any other diamond?"

Feedback:

If YES, the Sat 8:00 AM slot on Diamond 1 should turn RED and shake. The drop is disabled.

If NO, the slot turns GREEN, confirming "This is a valid slot."

Visual State Differentiation: Use color to communicate state at a glance.

Striped/Red Blocks: House League games (imported from your calendar). These are read-only and unmovable.

Blue Blocks: Games you have placed from the "bank" (your draft).

Gray Blocks: Games other coaches have booked (from your other module idea).

"Snap-to-Grid" and "Resize": Don't let the user drop a game at "8:07 AM." The game block should "snap" to the 15-minute or 30-minute lines on your grid. You should also be able to grab the bottom of the game block to "resize" it, changing its duration from 1.5 to 2 hours.

🛠️ My Technical Recommendation
To build this "pro" feel, don't try to reinvent the wheel. I strongly recommend using a dedicated drag-and-drop library.

The modern, best-in-class library for this in React is dnd-kit. It's lightweight, accessible, and has all the hooks you need to build these complex interactions (like "hot" zones and conflict detection) cleanly.
