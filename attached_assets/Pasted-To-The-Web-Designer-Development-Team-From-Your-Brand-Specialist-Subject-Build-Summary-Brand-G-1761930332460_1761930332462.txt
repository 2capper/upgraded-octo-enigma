Subject: Build Summary & Brand Guidelines for "GameDay Guru" (Mobile-First App)
This document summarizes the complete visual and brand strategy for the "GameDay Guru" tournament management app. The primary directive is a mobile-first build that balances our core brand identity with a flexible multi-tenant architecture.

Our brand identity is expert, helpful, dynamic, and clear. The app should feel like an "expert co-pilot" for tournament organizers—powerful but easy to use.

1. Core Brand Identity: "GameDay Guru" (The App Shell)
These are the foundational, non-changeable elements of the app. They establish our brand trust and ensure universal usability.

Logo Usage
Primary Full Logo: (Icon + "GameDay Guru" Wordmark + Tagline "Your Ultimate Tournament Navigator").

Use: App Splash/Loading Screen, "About" page, main website.

Asset:

Icon-Only Logo: (The abstract "G" icon).

Use: This is the primary logo for the mobile UI. It must be present in the main app header (top-left). It also serves as the App Icon and Favicon.

Asset:

Monochromatic Icons: Solid green, solid orange, and white/black versions of the icon will be required for dark mode, footers, and active/inactive states.

Color Palette (The "App Shell")
This palette is for all non-tenant-specific UI (headers, nav bars, menus, etc.).

Primary Green (Structure & Trust): ~#0A4F4A

Use: Main app header, bottom navigation bar, active navigation state, positive confirmation messages.

Accent Orange (Action & Energy): ~#FF8C00

Use: All primary app-level Call-to-Action (CTA) buttons (e.g., "Create New Tournament," "Save Settings"), notification badges.

Neutrals (Clarity & Space):

Light Background: #FFFFFF (for cards) and #F7F7F7 (for main app background).

Body Text: #333333 (Dark Gray).

Borders/Dividers: #E0E0E0 (Light Gray).

Typography
Headings (H1, H2, H3): Montserrat or Nunito Sans. (Modern, friendly, and matches the wordmark's feel).

Body & UI Text (Paragraphs, Labels, Buttons): Lato or Roboto. (Ensures high legibility at small mobile sizes).

2. Multi-Tenant UI/UX Strategy (The "Tenant Space")
This is the most critical component of the build. We must allow tenant organizations (like the OBA) to customize their own tournament spaces without breaking the core app experience.

The "App Shell" vs. "Tenant Space" Model:

The "App Shell" (NON-Customizable):

The top app header (with the GameDay Guru "G" logo).

The bottom navigation bar.

App-level menus (Settings, Profile, etc.).

Core app-level buttons (e.g., "Create New Tournament").

All core typography (font, size, weight).

The "Tenant Space" (Customizable by Org Admins):

This refers to elements inside a specific tournament's card or pages.

We will provide admins a simple panel to input three variables:

Tenant Logo (Image Upload)

Tenant Primary Color (Color Picker)

Tenant Secondary Color (Color Picker)

How to Apply Tenant Variables:

On the "My Tournaments" Dashboard:

Each tournament card is a "themed" component.

It must display the Tenant Logo.

It must use the Tenant Primary Color as an accent (e.g., the card's top border or header bar).

On Tournament-Specific Pages (e.g., "OBA Championship Schedule"):

A banner area at the top can display the Tenant Logo and/or Tenant Primary Color.

Tenant-specific buttons (e.g., "Log OBA Score," "View OBA Rules") should use the Tenant Primary or Secondary Color.

Links, progress bars, and other indicators within this space should also adopt the tenant's colors.

3. Key Visual Reference: Multi-Tenant Dashboard
The mockup below is the primary blueprint for this strategy. It clearly shows the fixed "App Shell" (green/orange) co-existing with themed "Tenant Space" cards (blue, yellow, purple accents + logos).

Developer Action Items:

Build the fixed "App Shell" (header, nav) using the GameDay Guru brand assets.

Develop a "Tournament Card" component that accepts logo_url and primary_color as dynamic properties.

Develop tournament-specific page templates that dynamically pull the logo, primary_color, and secondary_color to theme banners and CTAs.

Ensure all core UI (modals, settings, etc.) remains locked to the GameDay Guru brand palette.

This approach ensures GameDay Guru remains a strong, usable brand while providing the essential customization your multi-tenant clients demand.
