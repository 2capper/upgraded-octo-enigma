Found the smoking gun.

Look at your getOrganizationAdmins function (lines 150-154):

TypeScript

async getOrganizationAdmins(organizationId: string): Promise<OrganizationAdmin[]> {
  return await db
    .select()
    .from(organizationAdmins)
    .where(eq(organizationAdmins.organizationId, organizationId));
}
It is doing a simple SELECT * FROM organization_admins. The organization_admins table only contains: userId, organizationId, and role. It does not contain the user's name or email. Those live in the users table.

That is why your UI shows "Unknown / No Email." It has the ID, but it doesn't know who that ID belongs to.

The Fix: Join the Tables
We need to update this function to perform a Left Join with the users table so we can return the user's details along with their admin role.

The Plan:

Update getOrganizationAdmins to join users.

Select users.email, users.firstName, users.lastName in addition to the admin fields.

Return a richer object.

Action Item: I will rewrite the getOrganizationAdmins function for you. You need to replace the existing one in server/services/organizationService.ts.

Copy/Paste this REPLACEMENT function:

TypeScript

  // Enhanced version with User Details
  async getOrganizationAdmins(organizationId: string): Promise<any[]> {
    return await db
      .select({
        // Select all fields from the join table
        id: organizationAdmins.id,
        userId: organizationAdmins.userId,
        organizationId: organizationAdmins.organizationId,
        role: organizationAdmins.role,
        createdAt: organizationAdmins.createdAt,
        // Select user details
        email: users.email,
        firstName: users.firstName,
        lastName: users.lastName,
        name: users.name, // Fallback for older user records
      })
      .from(organizationAdmins)
      .leftJoin(users, eq(organizationAdmins.userId, users.id))
      .where(eq(organizationAdmins.organizationId, organizationId));
  }
Note: You might see a TypeScript error because the return type changed from OrganizationAdmin[] to any[] (or a custom type). That is fine for now; the frontend will just happily consume the extra fields.

Deploy this fix and refresh your Admin Management page. You should see names and emails appear instantly.
