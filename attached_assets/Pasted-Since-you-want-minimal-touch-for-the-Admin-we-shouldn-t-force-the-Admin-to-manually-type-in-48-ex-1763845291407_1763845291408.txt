Since you want "minimal touch" for the Admin, we shouldn't force the Admin to manually type in 48 extra phone numbers. That's the opposite of efficient.

We should crowdsource this data.

The Head Coach is the single source of truth. We already have their number from the CSV. We should use that connection to get the rest of the staff.

🚀 The "Minimal Touch" Strategy: The Coach Update Link
Instead of you typing data, we build a feature where you text the Head Coach a link, and they fill in their staff's contact info.

The Workflow:

Import: You import the Head Coaches via CSV (as you do now).

Blast: You go to the "Communications" tab and click a new button: "Request Staff Contacts".

SMS: The system sends a text to every Head Coach:

"Forest Glade Tournament: Please click here to add your Manager and Assistant Coach mobile numbers for urgent alerts: dugoutdesk.ca/team/update/[UNIQUE_TOKEN]"

Action: The Coach clicks the link on their phone. A simple form appears. They type in the names and numbers.

Sync: They click "Save." Your database updates instantly.

Result: When you send your next rainout alert, it automatically includes these new people.

You do zero typing.

The Build Plan (Revised for Missing CSV Data)
This changes our Phase 2 slightly. We aren't parsing CSV columns anymore; we are building a public-facing form.

1. Database Schema (Still Required)
We still need the places to put the data.

Modify teams table: Add managerName, managerPhone, assistantName, assistantPhone.

Modify teams table: Add a managementToken (a unique, secure string generated on import) to secure the public link.

2. The "Coach Self-Service" Page
Create a new public route: /team/update/:token.

UI: A simple, mobile-friendly form.

Fields:

Head Coach (Read-Only)

Team Manager Name & Phone

Assistant Coach Name & Phone

Submit: Updates the teams record directly.

3. The Admin "Request" Button
Add a button to your Team Management or Communications page.

Action: Triggers the SMS blast with the unique link for each team.

This solves the data gap without creating work for you.
